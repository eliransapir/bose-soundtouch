# AirPlay and Bose SoundTouch scripts

Tap into [Daniel Bahls](http://www.danielbahl.dk/) awesome scripts for Bose SoundTouch and Apple AirPlay. I use this GitHub-project to publish scripts and code for improving my life with AirPlay.


# iTunes-AirPlay.scpt 

**This is a simple AppleScript for controlling iTunes and AirPlay**

This script can be used with all AirPlay-devices including Bose SoundTouch, AirPort Express etc.
Video-demo available at www.danielbahl.dk

The script detects all available AirPlay Devices and sets the audio volume to 0, it then plays a predefined playlist with either local music, iCloud music or a streaming audio file / radio station. It will slowly turn up the volume to a predefined value, perfect for using as a alarm clock in the morning.
