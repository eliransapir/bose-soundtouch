AirPlay and Bose SoundTouch scripts
===============

This GitHub contains awesome scripts for Bose SoundTouch and Apple AirPlay by Daniel Bahl

===============

* iTunes-AirPlay.scpt
This is a simple AppleScript for controlling iTunes and AirPlay. 

This script can be used with all AirPlay-devices including Bose SoundTouch, AirPort Express etc.
Video-demo available at www.danielbahl.dk

The script detects all available AirPlay Devices and sets the audio volume to 0, it then plays a predefined playlist with either local music, iCloud music or a streaming audio file / radio station. It will slowly turn up the volume to a predefined value, perfect for using as a alarm clock in the morning.
